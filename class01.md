**HTML Structure**
 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files are, basically, just simple text files that you could create in any text editor. But to be displayed correctly on the World Wide Web, an HTML document must be structured correctly. Any variation from this structure will cause many web browsers to show the content incorrectly or not at all. Also, all HTML documents must have a suffix of “html” for the HTML code to be viewed correctly by a web browser.

 **Attributes**

 Some tags may also include an attribute, which is additional information that is included only within the start tag. Attributes are specific to each tag, although there are many similarities. Some tags must have an attribute to function properly. An example of an attribute is shown in the first paragraph tag shown in the example above (<p align="center">.) The web standards suggests that all attribute parameters be contained within quotes. For example, it is not correct to have this: <p align=center>

**HTML Extra Markup:**

* **Markup** is what HTML tags do to the text inside of them; they mark it as a specific type of text. For example, markup text could come in the form of boldface or italicized type to draw specific attention to a word or phrase.
* **A markup** tag is a directive that contains snippet of code with a relative reference to an object in your store such as a variable, URL, image, or block. Markup tags can be used anywhere the editor is available and incorporated into the HTML of email and newsletter templates, as well as other types of content.

**Tag	Description**
<h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings.
<hr>	Produce a horizontal line.
<html>	Defines the root of an HTML document.
<i>	Displays text in an italic style.

**HTML5** is introducing a new set of 
elements that help define the structure of 
a page.
Website Layout Using HTML5
HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define different parts of a web page:

**HTML5 Semantic Elements	**
**<header> **- Defines a header for a document or a section
**<nav>** - Defines a container for navigation links
**<section>** - Defines a section in a document
**<article>** - Defines an independent self-contained article
**<aside> **- Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
**<footer>** - Defines a footer for a document or a section
**<details>** - Defines additional details
**<summary>** - Defines a heading for the <details> element

**HTML Layout Using <div> Elements**
The <div> element is often used as a layout tool, because it can easily be positioned with CSS.
**HTML Layout Using Tables**
The <table> element was not designed to be a layout tool.
The purpose of the <table> element is to display tabular data.
**Process and Design using html**
The design process is a project management guide used to oversee the execution of a large project, typically involving breaking it up into smaller chunks and evaluating progress at several specific milestones.

**JAVAScript**
Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

A

**What is a script and how do I create one?**

B

**How do computers fit in with the world around them?**

C

**How do I write a script for a web page?**

Once you have learned the basics, the following chapters will show how the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.
A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following:

RECIPES
By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.

Some scripts are simple and only deal with one individual scenario, like a simple recipe for a basic dish. Other scripts can perform many tasks, like a recipe for a complicated three-course meal.

Another similarity is that, if you are new to cooking or programming, there is a lot of new terminology to learn.

**ABC **is an interactive programming language and environment for personal computing, originally intended as a good replacement for BASIC. It was designed by first doing a task analysis of the programming task.

ABC is easy to learn (an hour or so for someone who has already programmed), and yet easy to use. Originally intended as a language for beginners, it has evolved into a powerful tool for beginners and experts alike.

Here is an example function words to collect the set of all words in a document:

   HOW TO RETURN words document:
      PUT {} IN collection
      FOR line IN document:
         FOR word IN split line:
            IF word not.in collection:
               INSERT word IN collection
      RETURN collection
Some features of the language:

a powerful collection of only 5 data types that can easily be combined
strong typing, yet without declarations
no limitations (such as max int), apart from sheer exhaustion of memory
refinements to support top-down programming
nesting by indentation
programs typically one fourth or one fifth the size of the equivalent Pascal or C.
Some features of the environment:

no need for files: procedures and functions and global variables remain after logging out
one consistent face is shown to the user at all times, whether executing commands, editing, or entering input to a program
generalized undo mechanism.
