## HTML | Text Formatting
HTML provides us with the ability for formatting text just like we do it in MS Word or any text editing software. In this article, we would go through few such options. 
 

Making text Bold or Strong: We can make the text bold using the <b> tag. The tag uses both opening and closing tag. The text that needs to be made bold must be within <b> and </b> tag. 
We can also use the <strong> tag to make the text strong, with added semantic importance. It also opens with <strong> and ends with </strong> tag. 
Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>Bold</title>
</head>
<body>
	<!--Normal text-->
	
<p>Hello GeeksforGeeks</p>

	<!--Text in Bold-->
	
<p><b>Hello GeeksforGeeks</b></p>

	<!--Text in Strong-->
	
<p><strong>Hello GeeksforGeeks</strong></p>

</body>
</html>
Making text Italic or emphasize: The <i> tag is used to italicise the text. It opens with <i> and ends with </i> tag. 
The <em> tag is used to emphasize the text, with added semantic importance. It opens with <em> and ends with </em> tag.
